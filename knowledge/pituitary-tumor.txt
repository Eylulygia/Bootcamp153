Pituitary tumors are abnormal growths located in the pituitary gland, a small endocrine organ at the base of the brain.

Most pituitary tumors are benign adenomas. Common types include prolactinomas, ACTH-producing tumors, and growth hormone-secreting adenomas.

These tumors can affect hormone production, causing systemic symptoms such as Cushingâ€™s disease or acromegaly. Visual disturbances may occur if the tumor compresses the optic chiasm.

Diagnosis typically involves MRI imaging and serum hormone level analysis. Treatment options include surgical resection (often via transsphenoidal approach), dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline), and radiotherapy.
