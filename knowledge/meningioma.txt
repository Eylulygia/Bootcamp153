Meningiomas arise from the arachnoid layer of the meninges and are typically slow-growing, benign tumors.

They represent about 30% of all primary brain tumors and are more common in women.

Symptoms vary depending on location and size. Common signs include headaches, personality changes, or seizures.

CT and MRI imaging show an extra-axial mass with dural attachment. Surgical resection is the primary treatment; radiation may be used for recurrence or inoperable tumors. Prognosis is generally favorable.
